================================================================================================

This a couple of programs that implement two well known randomized primality testing algorithms:
Miller-Rabin and Solovay-Strassen. 

The idea was to test Haskell's support for concurrency and
parallelization. To run it you need a multicore machine.

================================================================================================

1.To run the two programs you must have a Haskell compiler installed.

2.Install the parallel package from Hackage. For instance by typing

 	 cabal install parallel

   at the command prompt, if you have cabal installed.

3.Install the random package from Hackage. For instance by typing

	cabal install random

4.To compile type

	ghc -threaded -O2 <program name>.hs --make -fforce-recomp

5.To run the program use
	
	./<program name> +RTS -N
